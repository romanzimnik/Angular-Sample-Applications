# Angular-Sample-Applications

## Welcome to the world of Angular!

Let us first clarify the most important questions:

- **What is this repository about?**

    It contains several Angular-based sample applications I developed to get to know with Angular concepts and functionality.

- **For whom might this repository be helpful?**

    People who have just started or want to start with Angular and need some support in the form of documented code.

## List of sample applications

1. `password-generator-application`

    Start with that one, if you are totally new to Angular! This is by far the most simple app. It is a simple one-component based sample asking for user input and implementing some of Angulars conditional magic, as well as event and attribute binding explained.
